Right now I see a HUGE focus on quality and reliability. When the quality frameworks and best practices get firmly established, what’s the next area of innovation?

There’s a few areas that are ripe for innovation beyond data quality.

1. Data velocity
Streaming will continue to see higher adoption as the skills become more ubiquitous throughout industry. Data engineers who learn Flink/Spark Streaming will have a salary increment for it just like those that are amazing at batch Spark now.

2. The birth of data products
Offline data is mostly used for analytics and strategic use cases right now. Closing the loop where data can go from logging -> offline -> online is a huge area of opportunity that businesses will continue to invest in. This will mean data engineers should learn more about online systems and how to do “production ML”

3. Data privacy and governance
Data privacy will continue to be a HUGE area of focus for the years to come. Having a focus on this and learning about access controls, retention policies, and the legal repercussions of violations will help data engineers develop more privacy-compliant data warehouses.
